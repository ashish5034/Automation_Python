# The code you provided is a Python script that allows you to scan and list the files in a specified directory using the os.walk function. Here's how it works:

# It imports the sys module to access command-line arguments and the os module to work with the file system.

from sys import *

# It checks the number of command-line arguments using len(argv). If there are not exactly two arguments (script name + directory name), it prints an "Invalid Number of Arguments" error message and exits.

    if (len(argv) != 2):
        print("Invalid Number of Arguments")

        print("Example: Demo.py Marvellous")
        exit()
